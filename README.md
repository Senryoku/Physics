Physics
=======

Simple 2D physics engine.
This is a C++ "port" of the engine used in https://github.com/Senryoku/jump-n-run

SFML dependency is for test display only and completly optional. 
However, there is some debug OpenGL code scattered in each component of the physics library...
It could be easly scrapped, I just don't have the will to do it (and above all, no reason to).
